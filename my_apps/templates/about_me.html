    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        Hello, I'm Arthur Siew, a junior web developer with a passion for building dynamic and responsive web applications. 
        Over the past 4 years, I've worked in various agritech and agriculture ventures, primarily in the areas of aquaculture, livestock, and horticulture. 
        My journey into IT and web development was inspired by the fact that technology has become an integral part of our daily lives and is applicable across all industries.
    </p>

    <h3>My Journey</h3>
    <p>
        While working in agritech, I realized that IT solutions are crucial to modernizing agriculture and improving efficiency. This sparked my interest in technology and web development. 
        As I explored the potential of IT, I recognized that there are numerous opportunities to work on projects across different sectors, particularly in areas like IoT, AI, and Data.
    </p>
    <p>
        This newfound passion led me to pursue a career shift into web development. I started learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and later expanded my skills into backend technologies like Python and Django. 
        In 2024, I enrolled in the Lithan Academy Specialist Diploma in Software Engineering and started my Master of Science in Computer Science. These courses have provided me with the foundational knowledge and hands-on experience needed to build robust web applications.
    </p>

    <h3>Current Focus</h3>
    <p>
        Right now, I am diving deeper into full-stack development, working with Python, Django, and React.js. I am also exploring the potential of Web3 and Solidity programming through Metana, with a strong interest in blockchain technologies. 
        As I continue to expand my skill set, I am looking for ways to integrate my knowledge of agriculture with emerging technologies like IoT and AI, which offer exciting possibilities in improving both the agricultural and technology sectors.
    </p>

    <h3>Future Aspirations</h3>
    <p>
        My future aspirations involve building innovative solutions that leverage IoT, AI, and blockchain technologies. I'm eager to contribute to the development of projects that address global challenges, especially in agriculture, healthcare, and sustainability. 
        I also plan to further my knowledge in cloud computing and DevOps to enhance my understanding of infrastructure and software deployment in real-world applications.
    </p>

    <h3>Hobbies and Interests</h3>
    <p>
        Outside of work, I enjoy reading and researching topics like artificial intelligence, IoT, and aquaculture technology. Iâ€™m also passionate about staying active, which is why I love going to the gym, playing PC games, and practicing combat sports such as boxing and wrestling.

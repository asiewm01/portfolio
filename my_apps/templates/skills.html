    <h2>Skills</h2>
    <p>
        As a web developer with a diverse background, I have built a solid foundation in both front-end and back-end technologies. Over the years, I have worked with a wide array of tools and frameworks to develop dynamic, responsive, and user-friendly web applications. My journey into web development started with an exploration of frontend technologies, where I honed my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. From there, I delved deeper into back-end development, working with Python, Django, and SQL to build scalable and efficient web applications.
    </p>
    <p>
        Beyond development, I also have hands-on experience with version control and deployment tools such as Git and GitHub, ensuring smooth collaboration on projects. I have worked with cloud platforms, containerization tools like Docker, and deployment services such as Heroku and Netlify, to deliver applications that are robust and easy to maintain.
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition to my technical skills, I am also experienced in Digital Marketing, with a particular focus on SEO, Google Ads, and Social Media Marketing. My knowledge in these areas allows me to build websites that are optimized for search engines and are able to attract and engage audiences. I also leverage tools like Google Analytics to track user behavior and optimize website performance.
    </p>
    <p>
        My goal as a developer is not only to write clean, functional code but also to understand the business context and user needs. I continuously seek opportunities to expand my skill set, explore new technologies, and contribute to impactful projects that align with my interests in agriculture, AI, IoT, and sustainability.

            <h2><u>Hi, I am Arthur Siew</u></h2>
            <p>I am a passionate junior web developer with a strong foundation in both front-end and back-end technologies. My journey into web development began with my background in digital marketing, specifically SEO, where I honed my problem-solving and technical skills. Iâ€™ve always been fascinated by the potential of technology to solve real-world problems, and this sparked my transition into the world of web development.</p>

            <p>With a solid grounding in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python, I specialize in full-stack development. I have experience working with modern frameworks like React for the front-end and Django for the back-end. I am particularly interested in building scalable and responsive web applications that are not only functional but also user-friendly and visually appealing.</p>

            <p>In addition to my technical skills, I am deeply motivated by the idea of continuous learning and growth. I believe that technology is an ever-evolving field, and I am committed to staying up to date with the latest trends and innovations. Currently, I am furthering my education at Lithan Academy, where I am working towards a Specialist Diploma in Software Engineering. I am also exploring emerging technologies like Web3, Blockchain, and Cloud Computing, which I believe will shape the future of the digital landscape.</p>

            <p>As I continue to expand my skill set, my ultimate goal is to leverage my expertise in web development, blockchain, and cloud technologies to build innovative solutions that can have a meaningful impact across industries. I am particularly passionate about how these technologies can contribute to improving sectors like agriculture, sustainability, and healthcare.</p>

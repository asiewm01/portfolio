        <h2 class="text-center">How This Site Was Built</h2>
        <p class="text-center">This website is built using a combination of cutting-edge technologies to provide a seamless user experience, secure backend, and efficient performance. Below is an overview of the tech stack that powers this site:</p>

        <h3>Frontend Technologies</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>React:</strong> A JavaScript library used for building dynamic and responsive user interfaces. It allows for a modular approach to development, making it easier to update and maintain.</li>
            <li><strong>HTML5 & CSS3:</strong> The building blocks of the website's structure and styling. HTML defines the page structure, while CSS handles the design and layout, ensuring a responsive design across devices.</li>
            <li><strong>Bootstrap:</strong> A powerful front-end framework used for building mobile-first websites with a responsive grid system. It speeds up development with pre-designed UI components.</li>
            <li><strong>jQuery:</strong> A JavaScript library used to simplify DOM manipulation, event handling, and AJAX requests, making the development process more efficient.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Backend Technologies</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Django:</strong> A high-level Python web framework used for building secure and scalable web applications. Django handles the server-side logic, routing, and database queries.</li>
            <li><strong>Python:</strong> The primary programming language used for backend logic. Python is known for its simplicity and versatility, making it ideal for web development.</li>
            <li><strong>MySQL:</strong> A relational database management system used to store and manage the website's data. MySQL ensures efficient querying and handling of structured data.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Development Tools</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Git & GitHub:</strong> Git is used for version control, and GitHub is used to host the project repository. This helps in tracking changes and collaborating with others.</li>
            <li><strong>Heroku / Netlify:</strong> Platforms used for deploying the website to the cloud, ensuring itâ€™s accessible to users worldwide. Heroku and Netlify offer easy-to-use deployment pipelines for full-stack applications.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Why These Technologies?</h3>
        <p>The combination of these technologies provides a balanced and scalable approach to building a web application. Django and Python offer a strong foundation for backend development, while React, Bootstrap, and jQuery enhance the frontend experience.</p>

        <h3>Challenges and Learning</h3>
        <p>Throughout the development of this site, I faced challenges such as ensuring the responsiveness of the design and integrating React with Django for a smooth user experience. However, I enjoyed overcoming these challenges and expanding my skillset in both frontend and backend technologies.</p>

        <h3>Future Improvements</h3>
        <p>In the future, I plan to optimize the website's performance further, improve accessibility, and expand its features to make it more interactive. Additionally, I will continue learning about emerging technologies such as Web3, blockchain, and machine learning to integrate them into future projects.</p>
